    "## Introduction\n",
    "Phishing is a common form of cyber attacks, where 80% of reported security incidents in 2021 are phishing attacks. According to CISCO's 2021 Cybersecurity Threat Trends report, approximiately 90% of data breaches on the internet came from phishing ([article](https://spanning.com/blog/cyberattacks-2021-phishing-ransomware-data-breach-statistics/#:~:text=How%20common%20was%20phishing%20in,breaches%20occur%20due%20to%20phishing.)). Phishing attackes may take the forms of emails, texts, or phone calls during which the victim is asked to enter sensitive information such as credit card numbers and login credentials. In order to contribute to the anti-phishing efforts, the goal of this project is to identify phishing websites given their URLs using machine learning methods."

    "The data set is from Kaggle ([data set link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning?resource=download)). This dataset consists of 5000 phishing websites and 5000 legitimate websites from January to May 2015 and from May to June 2017. There are 48 features in total, which will be explained later."
